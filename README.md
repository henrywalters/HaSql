# HaSql
a c++ database system for stream lined memory in other projects

to access all features of the database system, you may use the hasql command line.  Ininitialze the class in a main function and run e.g.hasql_cmdline();

The command line relies on cmdline maker.

commands:

OPEN {database_name}

CLOSE

NEW ENTRY

STATUS

SELECT {keyword} FROM {column_title}

This app/class duality will be used in my soon to be released project.
